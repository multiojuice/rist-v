Very ambitious ... whole semester-long university courses dedicated to writing a
micro-OS in Rust.

Presentation mentioned RISC-V and using QEmu and possibly an FPGA
implementation.  (Mentioning the target architecture would have been helpful in
the proposal writeup.)

Definitely aim for a modest MVP.

Keep track of the successes and, more importantly, the reasons for/lessons
learned from the failures and dead-ends.  Those will be useful information to
pass along at the Checkpoint and Final presentations.

Glad to hear that you've already started making some low-level progress.


Score: 10/10
